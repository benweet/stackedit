Developer guide
===============

Getting started
---------------

### Pre-requisites

- [Git][1]
- [node.js/npm][2]
- [Gulp][3]
- [Bower][4]

### Before debugging

- Download development tools:

        npm install

Download dependencies and build (done automatically after `npm install`)


- Serve **StackEdit** at `http://localhost:80/`:

        npm start

 Run **StackEdit** in debug mode (no application cache, serve original files instead of minified):

        http://localhost/?debug

### Add new dependencies

> **NOTE:** StackEdit uses [RequireJS][5] for asynchronous module definition ([AMD][6]).

- Install new dependencies using [Bower][7]:

        bower install <library> --save

- Add the new dependency to [RequireJS][8] configuration file (`main.js`):

        gulp bower-requirejs

### Build/minify

    gulp

### Deploy

- on Heroku:

        heroku create my-stackedit-instance
        git push heroku master

- in a Docker container:

        docker build -t my-stackedit-image .
        docker run -p 3000 my-stackedit-image

> **NOTE:** OAuth authorizations work out of the box for address `http://localhost/` except for WordPress. To allow another address, you have to add specific keys at the end of `constants.js` and eventually to set up specific proxies with the corresponding key/secret pairs ([WordPress Proxy][9], [Tumblr Proxy][10] and [Gatekeeper][11]).


Architecture
------------

![Architecture diagram][12]

The modules are loaded by RequireJS in the following order:

1. The 3rd party libraries (jQuery, underscore.js...)
2. The `Extension` modules
3. The `eventMgr` module
4. The `core` module
5. The `fileMgr` module and the helpers modules
6. The `Provider` modules
7. The `publisher` and `synchronizer` modules

This is important to notice in order to avoid circular dependencies. For instance, if an `Extension` is declared with the `core` module as a dependency, RequireJS will inject `undefined` instead of the actual module.

Any module though can access any dependencies by implementing the proper [injection listener][13] provided by the `eventMgr`.

----------


### core

The `core` module is responsible for:

- creating the [UI Layout][14], the [ACE][15] editor and the [PageDown][16] editor,
- loading/saving the settings,
- running periodic tasks,
- detecting the user activity,
- checking the offline status.

**Attributes:**

- `isOffline`: indicates the offline status of the application.

**Methods:**

- `onReady(callback)`: sets a callback to be called when all modules have been loaded and the DOM is ready.
> **NOTE:** This is preferred over [jQuery's `.ready()`][17] because it ensures that all AMD modules are loaded by [RequireJS][18].

- `runPeriodically(callback)`: sets a callback to be called every second.
> **NOTE:** The callback will not run if the user is inactive or in StackEdit Viewer. User is considered inactive after 5 minutes of inactivity (mouse or keyboard).

- `setOffline()`: can be called by any other modules when a network timeout occurs for instance.
> **NOTE:** the offline status is also set by detecting the window `offline` event. `core.isOffline` is automatically set to `false` when the network is recovered.

- `initEditor(fileDesc)`: creates or refreshes the [PageDown][19] editor with a given [`FileDescriptor`][20] object.


----------


### fileMgr

The `fileMgr` module is responsible for:

- creating and deleting local files,
- switching from one file to another.

**Attributes:**

- `currentFile`: the [`FileDescriptor`][21] object that is currently edited.

**Methods:**

- `createFile(title, content)`: creates a [`FileDescriptor`][22] object, add it in the [`fileSystem`][23] map and returns it.
- `deleteFile(fileDesc)`: deletes a [`FileDescriptor`][24] object from the [`fileSystem`][25] map.
- `selectFile(fileDesc)`: selects a [`FileDescriptor`][26] object for editing.


#### FileDescriptor

The `FileDescriptor` class represents a local file. A `FileDescriptor` object has the following properties:

- `fileIndex`: the unique string index of the file in the file system.
- `title`: the title of the document.
- `content`: the content of the document.
- `syncLocations`: a map containing all the associated [`syncAttributes`][27] objects with their `syncIndex` as a key.
- `publishLocations`: a map containing all the associated [`publishAttributes`][28] objects with their `publishIndex` as a key.

And the following methods:

- `addSyncLocation(syncAttributes)`: associates a [`syncAttributes`][29] object with the file.
- `removeSyncLocation(syncAttributes)`: unassociates a [`syncAttributes`][30] object with the file.
- `addPublishLocation(publishAttributes)`: associates a [`publishAttributes`][31] object with the file.
- `removePublishLocation(publishAttributes)`: unassociates a [`publishAttributes`][32] object with the file.

#### fileSystem

The `fileSystem` module is a map containing all the [`FileDescriptor`][33] objects with their `fileIndex` as a key.


----------


### synchronizer

The `synchronizer` module is responsible for:

- creating a new local file from a sync location (import).
- creating a new sync location from a local file (export).
- running 2 ways synchronization (upload and download) for all sync locations.

#### synchronizer's providers

A [`provider`][34] module can be associated with the `synchronizer` module if it implements the following functions:

- `importFiles()`: downloads one or multiple files and create local files associated with the sync locations.
- `exportFile()`: uploads a local file to a new sync location.
- `syncDown()`: performs a download of all the changes operated on all sync locations.
- `syncUp()`: performs an upload of a change to a sync location.

#### syncAttributes

A `syncAttributes` object is an object that describes a sync location. Attributes differ from one provider to another except for the following:

- `syncIndex`: the unique string index of the publish location.
- `provider`: the [`provider`][35] module that handles the sync location.


----------


### publisher

The `publisher` module is responsible for:

- creating new publish locations,
- updating existing publish locations.

#### publisher's providers

A [`provider`][36] module can be associated with the `publisher` module if it implements the following functions:

- `newPublishAttributes()`: returns a new [`publishAttributes`][37] object in order to create a new publish location.
- `publish()`: performs publishing of one publish location.

#### publishAttributes

A `publishAttributes` object is an object that describes a publish location. Attributes differ from one provider to another except for the following:

- `publishIndex`: the unique string index of the publish location.
- `provider`: the [`provider`][38] module that handles the publish location.
- `format`: the publishing format for the publish location. It can be:
    - `markdown` for Markdown format.
    - `html` for HTML format.
    - `template` for template format.


----------


### eventMgr

The `eventMgr` module is responsible for receiving and dispatching events. Below is the list of all events signatures.

Most events (those that are not triggered by the `eventMgr` module) can be triggered by calling methods of the same name in the `eventMgr` module. For example:

```js
eventMgr.onMessage('StackEdit is awesome!');
```

The method `addListener(eventName, callback)` of the `eventMgr` module can be used to listen to these events (except those that can only be handled by `Extension` modules). For example:

```js
eventMgr.addListener('onMessage', function(message) {
    alert(message);
});
```

`Extension` modules have the possibility to listen to those events by implementing methods of the same name. For example:

```js
myExtension.onMessage = function(message) {
    alert(message);
};
```


----------

#### Core events

- **`onReady()`**

    All the modules are loaded and the DOM is ready.

    - `message`: the text string of the message.

- **`onError(error)`**

    An error has been thrown.
    - `error`: an error object or a string.

    If the application creates its own image insertion dialog, this hook should
    return true, and the callback should be called with the chosen image url
    (or null if the user cancelled). If this hook returns false, the default
    dialog will be used.
    > Triggered by the `Markdown.Editor` module.

- **`insertLinkDialog`**

    plugin hook is the actual markdown source that will be cooked

    > Triggered by the `Markdown.Converter` module.

- **`postNormalization(text)`**

    called with the text once all normalizations have been completed (tabs to
    spaces, line endings, etc.), but before any conversions have been made

    > Triggered by the `Markdown.Converter` module.

    called with the final cooked HTML code. The result of this plugin hook is
    the actual output of makeHtml
