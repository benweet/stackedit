 * jGrowl 1.2.10
 *
 * Dual licensed under the MIT (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)
 * and GPL (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license.php) licenses.
 *
 * Written by Stan Lemon <stosh1985@gmail.com>
 * Last updated: 2013.02.14
 *
 * jGrowl is a jQuery plugin implementing unobtrusive userland notifications.  These 
 * notifications function similarly to the Growl Framework available for
 * Mac OS X (http://growl.info).
 *
 * To Do:
 * - Move library settings to containers and allow them to be changed per container
 *
 * Changes in 1.2.10
 * - Fix beforeClose to be called in click event
 *
 * Changes in 1.2.9
 * - Fixed BC break in jQuery 2.0 beta
 *
 * Changes in 1.2.8
 * - Fixes for jQuery 1.9 and the MSIE6 check, note that with jQuery 2.0 support
 *   jGrowl intends to drop support for IE6 altogether
 *
 * Changes in 1.2.6
 * - Fixed js error when a notification is opening and closing at the same time
 * 
 * Changes in 1.2.5
 * - Changed wrapper jGrowl's options usage to "o" instead of $.jGrowl.defaults
 * - Added themeState option to control 'highlight' or 'error' for jQuery UI
 * - Ammended some CSS to provide default positioning for nested usage.
 * - Changed some CSS to be prefixed with jGrowl- to prevent namespacing issues
 * - Added two new options - openDuration and closeDuration to allow 
 *   better control of notification open and close speeds, respectively 
 *   Patch contributed by Jesse Vincet.
 * - Added afterOpen callback.  Patch contributed by Russel Branca.
 *
 * Changes in 1.2.4
 * - Fixed IE bug with the close-all button
 * - Fixed IE bug with the filter CSS attribute (special thanks to gotwic)
 * - Update IE opacity CSS
 * - Changed font sizes to use "em", and only set the base style
 *
 * Changes in 1.2.3
 * - The callbacks no longer use the container as context, instead they use the actual notification
 * - The callbacks now receive the container as a parameter after the options parameter
 * - beforeOpen and beforeClose now check the return value, if it's false - the notification does
 *   not continue.  The open callback will also halt execution if it returns false.
 * - Fixed bug where containers would get confused
 * - Expanded the pause functionality to pause an entire container.
 *
 * Changes in 1.2.2
 * - Notification can now be theme rolled for jQuery UI, special thanks to Jeff Chan!
 *
 * Changes in 1.2.1
 * - Fixed instance where the interval would fire the close method multiple times.
 * - Added CSS to hide from print media
 * - Fixed issue with closer button when div { position: relative } is set
 * - Fixed leaking issue with multiple containers.  Special thanks to Matthew Hanlon!
 *
 * Changes in 1.2.0
 * - Added message pooling to limit the number of messages appearing at a given time.
 * - Closing a notification is now bound to the notification object and triggered by the close button.
 *
 * Changes in 1.1.2
 * - Added iPhone styled example
 * - Fixed possible IE7 bug when determining if the ie6 class shoudl be applied.
 * - Added template for the close button, so that it's content could be customized.
 *
 * Changes in 1.1.1
 * - Fixed CSS styling bug for ie6 caused by a mispelling
 * - Changes height restriction on default notifications to min-height
 * - Added skinned examples using a variety of images
 * - Added the ability to customize the content of the [close all] box
 * - Added jTweet, an example of using jGrowl + Twitter
 *
 * Changes in 1.1.0
 * - Multiple container and instances.
 * - Standard $.jGrowl() now wraps $.fn.jGrowl() by first establishing a generic jGrowl container.
 * - Instance methods of a jGrowl container can be called by $.fn.jGrowl(methodName)
 * - Added glue preferenced, which allows notifications to be inserted before or after nodes in the container
 * - Added new log callback which is called before anything is done for the notification
 * - Corner's attribute are now applied on an individual notification basis.
 *
 * Changes in 1.0.4
 * - Various CSS fixes so that jGrowl renders correctly in IE6.
 *
 * Changes in 1.0.3
 * - Fixed bug with options persisting across notifications
 * - Fixed theme application bug
 * - Simplified some selectors and manipulations.
 * - Added beforeOpen and beforeClose callbacks
 * - Reorganized some lines of code to be more readable
 * - Removed unnecessary this.defaults context
 * - If corners plugin is present, it's now customizable.
 * - Customizable open animation.
 * - Customizable close animation.
 * - Customizable animation easing.
 * - Added customizable positioning (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right, center)
 *
 * Changes in 1.0.2
 * - All CSS styling is now external.
 * - Added a theme parameter which specifies a secondary class for styling, such
 *   that notifications can be customized in appearance on a per message basis.
 * - Notification life span is now customizable on a per message basis.
 * - Added the ability to disable the global closer, enabled by default.
 * - Added callbacks for when a notification is opened or closed.
 * - Added callback for the global closer.
 * - Customizable animation speed.
 * - jGrowl now set itself up and tears itself down.
 *
 * Changes in 1.0.1:
 * - Removed dependency on metadata plugin in favor of .data()
 * - Namespaced all events

 return '\nWelcome to StackEdit!	{#welcome}\n=====================\n\n\nHello, I am your first Markdown document within **StackEdit**[^stackedit]. Don\'t delete me, I can be helpful. I can be recovered anyway in the `Utils` tab of the <i class="icon-cog"></i> `Settings` dialog.\n\n----------\n\n\nDocuments\n---------\n\n**StackEdit** stores your documents in the browser local storage, which means all your documents are automatically saved locally and are accessible offline.\n\n> **NOTE:** This also means that your documents are not shared between different browsers or computers and that clearing your browser\'s data may **delete all of them!**\n\n#### <i class="icon-file"></i> Create a document\n\nYou can create a new document by clicking the <i class="icon-file"></i> button in the navigation bar. This will switch from the current document to the new one.\n\n#### <i class="icon-folder-open"></i> Switch to another document\n\nYou can list all your local documents and switch from one to another by clicking the <i class="icon-folder-open"></i> button in the navigation bar.\n\n#### <i class="icon-pencil"></i> Rename a document\n\nYou can rename the current document by clicking the document title in the navigation bar.\n\n#### <i class="icon-trash"></i> Delete a document\n\nYou can delete the current document by clicking the <i class="icon-trash"></i> button in the navigation bar.\n\n#### <i class="icon-hdd"></i> Save a document\n\nYou can save the current document to a file using the <i class="icon-hdd"></i> `Save as...` sub-menu.\n\n> **NOTE:** See [<i class="icon-share"></i> Publish a document](#publish-a-document) section for a description of the different outputs.\n\n\n----------\n\n\nSynchronization\n---------------\n\n**StackEdit** can be combined with **Google Drive** and **Dropbox** to have your documents centralized in the *Cloud*. The synchronization mechanism will take care of uploading your modifications or downloading the latest version of your documents.\n\n> **NOTE:** Full access to **Google Drive** or **Dropbox** is required to be able to import any document in StackEdit. Imported documents are downloaded in your browser and are not transmitted to a server.\n\n#### <i class="icon-download"></i> Import a document\n\nYou can import a document from the *Cloud* by going to the <i class="icon-provider-gdrive"></i> `Google Drive` or the <i class="icon-provider-dropbox"></i> `Dropbox` sub-menu and by clicking `Import from...`. Once imported, your document will be automatically synchronized with the **Google Drive** / **Dropbox** file.\n\n#### <i class="icon-upload"></i> Export a document\n\nYou can export any document by going to the <i class="icon-provider-gdrive"></i> `Google Drive` or the <i class="icon-provider-dropbox"></i> `Dropbox` sub-menu and by clicking `Export to...`. Even if your document is already synchronized with **Google Drive** or **Dropbox**, you can export it to a another location. **StackEdit** can synchronize one document with multiple locations.\n\n#### <i class="icon-refresh"></i> Synchronize a document\n\nOnce your document is linked to a **Google Drive** or a **Dropbox** file, **StackEdit** will periodically (every 3 minutes) synchronize it by downloading/uploading any modification. Any conflict will be detected, and a local copy of your document will be created as a backup if necessary.\n\nIf you just have modified your document and you want to force the synchronization, click the <i class="icon-refresh"></i> button in the navigation bar.\n\n> **NOTE:** The <i class="icon-refresh"></i> button is disabled when:\n> \n> - you are offline,\n> - or the document is not synchronized with any location,\n> - or the document has not been modified since the last synchronization.\n\n#### <i class="icon-refresh"></i> Manage document synchronization\n\nSince one document can be synchronized with multiple locations, you can list and manage synchronized locations by clicking <i class="icon-refresh"></i> `Manage synchronization` in the <i class="icon-stackedit"></i> menu. This will open a dialog box allowing you to add or remove synchronization links that are associated to your document.\n\n> **NOTE:** If you delete the file from **Google Drive** or from **Dropbox**, the document will no longer be synchronized with that location.\n\n----------\n\n\nPublication\n-----------\n\nOnce you are happy with your document, you can publish it on different websites directly from **StackEdit**. As for now, **StackEdit** can publish on **Blogger**, **Dropbox**, **Gist**, **GitHub**, **Google Drive**, **Tumblr**, **WordPress** and on any SSH server.\n\n#### <i class="icon-share"></i> Publish a document\n\nYou can publish your document by going to the <i class="icon-share"></i> `Publish on` sub-menu and by choosing a website. In the dialog box, you can choose the publication format:\n\n- Markdown, to publish the Markdown text on a website that can interpret it (**GitHub** for instance),\n- HTML, to publish the document converted into HTML (on a blog for instance),\n- Template, to have a full control of the output.\n\n> **NOTE:** The default template is a simple webpage wrapping your document in HTML format. You can customize it in the `Publish` tab of the <i class="icon-cog"></i> `Settings` dialog.\n\n#### <i class="icon-share"></i> Update a publication\n\nAfter publishing, **StackEdit** will keep your document linked to that publish location so that you can update it easily. Once you have modified your document and you want to update your publication, click on the <i class="icon-share"></i> button in the navigation bar.\n\n> **NOTE:** The <i class="icon-share"></i> button is disabled when:\n> \n> - you are offline,\n> - or the document has not been published anywhere.\n\n#### <i class="icon-share"></i> Manage document publication\n\nSince one document can be published on multiple locations, you can list and manage publish locations by clicking <i class="icon-share"></i> `Manage publication` in the <i class="icon-stackedit"></i> menu. This will open a dialog box allowing you to remove publication links that are associated to your document.\n\n> **NOTE:** In some cases, if you remove the file from the website or the post from the blog, the document will no longer be published on that location.\n\n----------\n\n\nMarkdown Extra\n--------------\n\n**StackEdit** supports **Markdown Extra**, which extends **Markdown** syntax with some nice features.\n\n\n### Tables\n\n**Markdown Extra** has a special syntax for tables:\n\nItem      | Value\n--------- | -----\nComputer  | \\$1600\nPhone     | \\$12\nPipe      | \\$1\n\nYou can specify column alignment with one or two colons:\n\n| Item      |  Value | Qty  |\n| :-------- | ------:| :--: |\n| Computer  | \\$1600 |  5   |\n| Phone     |   \\$12 |  12  |\n| Pipe      |    \\$1 | 234  |\n\n\n### Definition Lists\n\n**Markdown Extra** has a special syntax for definition lists too:\n\nTerm 1\nTerm 2\n:   Definition A\n:   Definition B\n\nTerm 3\n\n:   Definition C\n\n:   Definition D\n\n	> part of definition D\n\n\n### Fenced code blocks\n\n**GitHub**\'s fenced code blocks are also supported with **Prettify** syntax highlighting:\n\n```\n// Foo\nvar bar = 0;\n```\n\n> **NOTE:** To use **Highlight.js** instead of **Prettify**, just configure the `Markdown Extra` extension in the <i class="icon-cog"></i> `Settings` dialog.\n\n\n### Special Attributes\n\nWith **Markdown Extra**, you can specify `class` and `id` attributes on headers and fenced code blocks just like this:\n\n##### Header example {#my-header}\n\n``` {#my-id .my-class}\nvar foo = bar;\n```\n\nThen you can create cross-references like this: [beginning of the document](#welcome).\n\n\n### Footnotes\n\nYou can create footnotes like this[^footnote].\n\n  [^footnote]: Here is the *text* of the **footnote**.\n\n\n### Table of contents\n\nYou can insert a table of contents using the marker `[TOC]`:\n\n[TOC]\n\n\n### MathJax\n \nYou can render *LaTeX* mathematical expressions using **MathJax**, as on [math.stackexchange.com][1]:\n\nThe *Gamma function* satisfying $\\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!\\quad\\forall\nn\\in\\mathbb N$ is via through the Euler integral\n\n$$\n\\Gamma(z) = \\int_0^\\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt\\,.\n$$\n\n> **NOTE:** When exporting, make sure you include MathJax to render mathematical expression correctly. Your page/template should include something like: \n\n```\n<script type="text/javascript" src="http://benweet.github.io/stackedit/lib/MathJax/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML"></script>\n```\n\n> **NOTE:** You can find more information:\n>\n> - about **Markdown** syntax [here][2],\n> - about **Markdown Extra** extension [here][3],\n> - about **Prettify** syntax highlighting [here][4].\n> - about **Highlight.js** syntax highlighting [here][5].\n\n  [^stackedit]: StackEdit is a free, open-source Markdown editor based on PageDown, the Markdown library used by Stack Overflow and the other Stack Exchange sites.\n\n\n  [1]: http://math.stackexchange.com/\n  [2]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax "Markdown"\n  [3]: https://github.com/jmcmanus/pagedown-extra "Pagedown Extra"\n  [4]: https://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/\n  [5]: http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/';
