**Where is my data stored?**

If your workspace is not synced, your files are only stored inside your browser using the [IndexedDB API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) and are not stored anywhere else.

We recommend syncing your workspace to make sure files won't be lost in case your browser data is cleared.

**Can StackEdit access my data without telling me?**

StackEdit is a frontend application. The access tokens issued by Google, Dropbox, GitHub... are stored in your browser and are not sent to any backend or 3^rd^ parties so your data won't be accessed by anyone.
